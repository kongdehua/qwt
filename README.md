# Qwt - Qt Widgets for Technical Applications
The Qwt Library contains GUI Components and utility classes which are primarily useful for programs with a technical background. Beside a framework for 2D plots it provides scales, sliders, dials, compasses, thermometers, wheels and knobs to control or display values, arrays, or ranges of type double.

## Plateforms
Qwt 6.1 might be usable in all environments where you find **Qt**. It is compatible with Qt4 and all Qt5 versions.
